DOORDASH INTEGRATION - CREDENTIALS GUIDE
========================================

For: West Row Kitchen Client
Purpose: Get DoorDash Drive API credentials for delivery integration

QUICK REFERENCE: WHERE TO GET EACH CREDENTIAL
=============================================

⚠️ NOTE: These are for DoorDash DRIVE API (delivery only), NOT checkout/payment.

✅ Partner ID / Merchant ID (Developer ID):
   Location: DoorDash Developer Portal (developer.doordash.com)
   Section: Usually at the top of the dashboard or "Account Settings"
   Action: Already displayed - just copy it

✅ API Key (Key ID):
   Location: DoorDash Developer Portal (developer.doordash.com)
   Section: "API Keys" or "Drive API" or "Credentials"
   Action: Find existing key OR click "Create New Key" / "Generate Key"
   ⚠️ Make sure it's for "Drive API" not "Checkout API"

✅ Secret Key (Signing Secret):
   Location: DoorDash Developer Portal (developer.doordash.com)  
   Section: Shown ONCE when you create/generate an API Key
   Action: Copy immediately after generating - you won't see it again!

✅ Webhook Secret (Optional, for delivery status updates):
   Location: DoorDash Developer Portal (developer.doordash.com)
   Section: "Webhooks" or "Webhook Configuration"
   Action: May need to enable webhooks first, then secret is generated

ALTERNATIVE LOCATIONS:
- Merchant Portal → "Settings" → "API" → "Drive API"
- Merchant Portal → "Partner Tools" → "Drive" → "API Settings"
- If you can't access Developer Portal, contact DoorDash Support

WHAT WE NEED
============
We need DoorDash Drive API credentials to integrate delivery services into 
your website. These credentials allow us to automatically request delivery 
drivers for confirmed orders.

WHERE TO GET THE CREDENTIALS
=============================

IMPORTANT: DoorDash uses TWO different portals:
1. Merchant Portal (merchants.doordash.com) - for daily operations
2. Developer Portal (developer.doordash.com) - for API credentials

You need to check BOTH portals to find all credentials.

⚠️ MAKE SURE: You're looking for "Drive API" credentials, NOT "Checkout API" 
   or "Embedded Ordering" credentials. We only need delivery/drive functionality.

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

METHOD 1: DoorDash Developer Portal (PRIMARY METHOD)
----------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Access Developer Portal
--------------------------------
1. Go to: https://developer.doordash.com
2. Click "Sign In" or "Log In"
3. Use the SAME email/password as your merchant account
   (If you don't have access, you may need to request it from DoorDash)

Step 2: Navigate to API Credentials
------------------------------------
1. Once logged in, look for one of these sections:
   - "API Keys" or "Credentials" in the left menu
   - "Applications" → "API Keys"
   - "Settings" → "API Credentials"
   - "Access Keys" or "Developer Keys"

Step 3: Find or Generate Your Credentials
------------------------------------------
You should see a page with your API credentials. Look for:

✅ Partner ID / Developer ID: 
   - This is usually shown at the top of the page
   - Format: A long string of numbers/letters
   - Location: Next to "Developer ID" or "Partner ID"

✅ API Key / Key ID:
   - Listed under "API Keys" or "Active Keys"
   - If you see "Create New Key" or "Generate Key", click it
   - Copy the Key ID (NOT the secret - that's next)
   - Format: Usually starts with numbers/letters

✅ Secret Key / Signing Secret:
   - This is shown ONCE when you create/generate the key
   - IMPORTANT: If you already have a key, you may need to CREATE A NEW ONE
   - Format: A long base64-encoded string
   - Location: Right after "API Key" - look for "Secret" or "Signing Secret"
   - ⚠️ WARNING: Copy this immediately - you won't see it again!

✅ Webhook Secret:
   - Look for "Webhooks" section or "Webhook Configuration"
   - May be under "Settings" → "Webhooks"
   - If you don't see it, you may need to enable webhooks first
   - Format: Another long string

METHOD 2: DoorDash Merchant Portal (ALTERNATIVE)
-------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Log into Merchant Portal
----------------------------------
1. Go to: https://merchants.doordash.com
2. Sign in with your merchant credentials

Step 2: Find Embedded Ordering or API Settings
-----------------------------------------------
1. Look in the left menu for:
   - "Embedded Ordering"
   - "Website Integration" 
   - "Settings" → "API" or "Developer"
   - "Partner Tools" → "Integration"

2. If you see "Embedded Ordering":
   - Click on it
   - Look for "API Credentials" or "Integration Settings"
   - You may see "View Credentials" or "Generate API Key" button

Step 3: Look for These Fields
------------------------------
In this section, you should see:
- Partner ID / Store ID
- API Key
- Secret Key
- Webhook Secret (may be in separate "Webhooks" tab)

Step 4: Check for Embedded Ordering
-----------------------------------
1. Look for "Embedded Ordering" or "Website Checkout" option
2. If you see it, make sure it's "Enabled" or "Active"
3. If it's not enabled, look for an "Enable" or "Activate" button

Step 5: Get Store Information
-----------------------------
Also copy these details:
Store ID: ________________
Store Name: ________________
Delivery Zones: ________________

IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE CREDENTIALS
==================================

Scenario 1: Can't Access Developer Portal
-----------------------------------------
If https://developer.doordash.com says "Access Denied" or you can't log in:

1. Contact DoorDash Support and ask:
   "I need access to the Developer Portal to generate API credentials for 
    website integration. Can you grant access to my account?"

2. They may need to:
   - Enable Developer Portal access for your account
   - Send you a special invitation link
   - Provide the credentials directly

Scenario 2: Credentials Don't Exist / Need to Generate
-------------------------------------------------------
If you see the Developer Portal but no API keys:

1. Look for a button that says:
   - "Create API Key"
   - "Generate New Key"
   - "Add Credentials"
   - "New Access Key"

2. Click it and follow the prompts

3. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: When generating:
   - Copy BOTH the Key ID AND the Secret immediately
   - The Secret is shown ONLY ONCE - save it right away!
   - If you lose the Secret, you'll need to generate a new key

Scenario 3: Webhook Secret Not Found
-------------------------------------
If you can't find the Webhook Secret:

1. Look for "Webhooks" section separately
2. You may need to:
   - Enable webhooks first
   - Configure a webhook endpoint (we'll provide this)
   - Then the secret will be generated
3. Or contact DoorDash - they can provide it

HOW TO CONTACT DOORDASH SUPPORT
================================

Option A: Email Support
-----------------------
1. In merchant portal, go to "Help" or "Support"
2. Click "Contact Support" or "Submit Ticket"
