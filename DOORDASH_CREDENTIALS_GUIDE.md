Subject: Need API Credentials for Website Integration

Hi,

I need API credentials to integrate DoorDash checkout into my website. 
I'm looking for:
- Partner ID
- API Key  
- Secret Key
- Webhook Secret
- Embedded Ordering access

Please help me find these in my merchant dashboard or provide them directly.

Thank you!
```

### **Option B: Check Your Account Type**
1. Look for **"Account Type"** or **"Plan"** in your dashboard
2. Make sure you have:

If you only have **"Drive"** plan, you'll need to upgrade to get checkout capabilities.
